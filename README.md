## 1.1-Polynomial Regression & Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Implemented polynomial regression and explored the bias-variance tradeoff using insurance data.

## 1.2-Simple Perceptron
Implemented a simple perceptron model to classify data and visualize the decision boundary.

## 2.1-KNN-Bagging-Boosting
Implemented KNN. Also tested and played around with multiple ensemble methods like bagging, random forest and AdaBoost.

## 2.2-PCA-KMeans
Implemented PCA and K-Means clustering from scratch.

## 3.1-MLP As Function Estimator
Implemented a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch to approximate mathematical functions.

## 3.2-MLP On MNIST
Implemented a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.

## 3.3-Optimizers implementation on MNIST
Implemented and compared different optimization algorithms like SGD with momentum, AdaGrad, RMSProp and Adam on the MNIST dataset using an MLP.

## 4-MobileNetV1-V2
Implemented and compared MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2 architectures for image classification.

## 5.1-Skipgram
Implemented the Skip-gram model for word embeddings using the Word2Vec algorithm.

## 5.2-Transformer-BERT-LoRA
Implemented transformer models, BERT, and LoRA techniques.

## 6-Knowledge Distillation using Contrastive Learning
Implemented knowledge distillation using contrastive learning to transfer knowledge from a large model to a smaller one.
